simple tool to play a sequence of mouse clicks and key strokes
==============
This tool will allow you to perform the following operations:

  - Mouse position (move the mouse to a particular coordinate)
  - Mouse Left Click (Left click action)
  - Mouse Left Double Click (Left Double click action)
  - Mouse Right Click (Richt click action)
  - Mouse Right Double Click (Right Double click action)
  - Press special key (Press a special key, RETURN, TAB, CONTROL, SHIFT, etc.)
  - Type message (Type any free message)

And play them in a sequence as many times as you want.
There is an action list which will keep all those actions stored and the tool will be able to play them in sequence as many times as you want using the "number of iterations" property.
